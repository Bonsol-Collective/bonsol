# Contract Interfaces

Bonsol hosts various libraries to help you interact with the Bonsol network. When interacting with Bonsol from a Solana program you will need to use the `bonsol-channel-interface` crate.

## Installing the crate
```bash
cargo add bonsol-channel-interface
```

## Usage 

See the [Interact with Bonsol Contracts/Programs](/docs/how-to/interact-with-contracts) section for more information on how to interact with Bonsol programs.
