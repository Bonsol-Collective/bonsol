### `init`: Initializing a new Bonsol Program

With the bonsol cli installed we can create a new bonsol program using the following command.

```bash
mkdir zkprograms
cd zkprograms
bonsol init --project-name collatz
```
This will create a new directory called `collatz` and initialize a new bonsol program in it. Your directory structure should look like this:
```
├── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.lock
├── src
│   └── main.rs
├── README.md

Notice that in Cargo.toml we have a new metadata section that specifies the zkprogram inputs.
When you generate a blank bonsol program it will look like this:

```toml
[package.metadata.zkprogram]
input_order = ["Public"]
```
This section is used when building the program to specify the types and order of the inputs.
The valid options are ["Public", "Private", "PublicProof"].
