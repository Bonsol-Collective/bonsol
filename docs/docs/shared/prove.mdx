### `prove`: Local Proving with the CLI

Local proving is a key feature of Bonsol. This allows you to prove computations that are impossible to run on-chain.
You can do this with the cli, using the `bonsol prove` command. In this scenario you will need to be proving against a deployed program.

```bash 
bonsol prove -f local.json  
```

Similar to the `bonsol execute` command, the cli takes a json file as an argument.
Here is an example of a valid local proving payload json file.

```json
{
  "imageId": "20b9db715f989e3f57842787badafae101ce0b16202491bac1a3aebf573da0ba",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "inputType": "Public",
      "data": "0x1234567890"
    }
  ]
}
```

The json schema for the local proving payload is hosted [here](https://github.com/anagrambuild/bonsol/blob/main/schemas/prove.schema.json).

#### Output 
If proving succeeds, the cli will return a serialized risc0 reciept. This is a binary format. 
the cli will save a file called `<execution_id>.bin` in the current directory or the directory specified with the `--output-dir <dir>` flag.
