### `prove`: Local Proving with the CLI

Local proving is a key feature of Bonsol. This allows you to prove computations that are impossible to run on-chain.
You can do this with the cli, using the `bonsol prove` command. In this scenario you will need to be proving against a deployed program.

```bash 
bonsol prove -f local.json  
```

Similar to the `bonsol execute` command, the cli takes a json file as an argument.
Here is an example of a valid local proving payload json file.

```json
{
  "imageId": "20b9db715f989e3f57842787badafae101ce0b16202491bac1a3aebf573da0ba",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "inputType": "Public",
      "data": "0x1234567890"
    }
  ]
}
```

The json schema for the local proving payload is hosted [here](https://github.com/anagrambuild/bonsol/blob/main/schemas/prove.schema.json).

#### Output 
If proving succeeds, the cli will return the proof and the output of the execution. You can choose the format of the output with the `--format` flag.

Two formats are supported:
* `json` - The default format, the cli will return the proof and the output of the execution in json format.
* `binary` - The cli will return the proof and the output of the execution in the flatbuffer binary format.

##### Binary Format
The binary format is a binary representation of the proof and the output of the execution. The binary format is useful for storing the proof on chain.
There are two components to the binary format, the proof and the output.

##### JSON Format 
The json format is a json representation of the proof and the output of the execution.
An example of the json format is shown below.
```json
{
  "proof": "...", // 
  "output": "adff...fsdfsdfZ=" //base64 encoded output of the execution
}
```
