### `deploy`: Deploying a Bonsol Zk Program

After building your zkprogram with "bonsol build ...", you can deploy it via the bonsol cli.

You have a few options for how you want to deploy:
Manual
S3
ShdwDrive

#### Manual
You can always upload your program anywhere on the internet as long as its publicly accessible by the relayer network.
Bonsol is very strict that the size of the bytes must match the size expected from the onchain deployment record. 
Manual deployment can be a cause of bugs and mismatches in this regard so we dont reccomend it.

To deploy manually you can use the following command.

```bash
bonsol deploy -m ./path-to-your-manifest.json {s3|shadow-drive|url}
```

#### S3
You can upload your program to s3 and have it be accessible by the relayer network. This is the recommended way to deploy your program.

```bash
bonsol deploy -m ./path-to-your-manifest.json s3 --access-key {your access key} --secret-key {your secret key}
```

#### ShadowDrive
ShadowDrive is a decentralized storage network that allows you to upload your program to a storage provider and have it be accessible by the relayer network. This is the recommended way to deploy your program.

If you have not already created a storage account you can create and upload in one command.
```bash
bonsol deploy -m ./path-to-your-manifest.json shadow-drive --storage-account-name {your storage account} --storage-account-size-mb {your storage account size in mb} --storage-account-name {your storage account name} --alternate-keypair {path to your alternate keypair}
```
Once you have created your storage account you can upload your program to it for the future versions of your program.
```bash
bonsol deploy -m ./path-to-your-manifest.json shadow-drive --storage-account {your storage account}  
```
